# Milestone plan
In this phase, it's time for making plans for the next milestone(s).

## Work breakdown structure
In a work breakdown structure (WBS), you try to divide the whole project into 
as small as possible work units. For example, if you're throwing a birthday 
party, one work unit may be *Order the cake*. A work unit should be the 
smallest thing you can do without having too much dependence on other things. 
If we take the birthday party example again, having a work unit be *Dial the 
phone number to the bakery* would be silly. That's way too small.

In a WBS, order of the work units is not important. It's enough to concentrate 
on trying to create as full a picture of the project as possible. When the WBS 
is done, ideally it should describe every single piece of work needed to 
complete the project. In an agile development project, this is rarely if ever 
possible. Instead, we should focus on an iterative WBS process, where we'll 
create a WBS for each milestone (or preferrably several). Remember, a milestone 
in this project plan is a release or deliverable.

The WBS may be written as an ordinary text file or Markdown file and committed 
to the repository, in the project file folder.
