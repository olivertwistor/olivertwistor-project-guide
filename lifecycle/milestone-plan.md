# Milestone plan
In this phase, it's time for making plans for the next milestone(s).

# Create issue
1. On the repository front page, press the *Issues* tab.
1. Press the green *New issue* button.
1. Write a short but descriptive *Title*. Example: `Make all buttons have 
yellow backgrounds and pink text colour`.
1. If you want to write more than just that short description, feel free to 
write it in the *Leave a comment* text box. Here you can write implementation 
details if you want, or perhaps argue for why this issue was created.
1. Assign a user by pressing the cogwheel besides *Assignees*. This can always 
be altered later, so if you're not sure about to whom to assign this issue, 
it's better to leave it empty for now.
1. Labels should at this stage have been created. If they haven't, please 
follow the [instructions on setting up basic labels][1] before continuing. When 
there are basic labels setup, press the cogwheel besides *Labels* and choose 
all labels that apply.
1. Leave both *Project* and *Milestone* be for now.
1. Press the *Submit new issue* button.

## Create milestone
To create a milestone and assign issues to it, follow these steps:

1. On the *Issues* tab on your project's repository page, press the button 
*Milestones*.
1. Press the button *New milestone*.
1. Give the milestone a *Title*. It doesn't have to be the same as the version 
number, but I recommend that.
1. Leave the *Due date* empty.
1. Write a description if you want. This can include the main changes that come 
with this release. You can just leave it empty.
1. Press the button *Create milestone*.

Now it's time to assign issues to the newly created milestone. Remember that in 
this project model, a milestone represents the changes necessary to go from one 
stable functioning state to another stable functioning state. A milestone 
should therefore include all the issues that are necessary to go between two 
functioning states. It could be as little as one issue, but it can be much 
larger. It depends on the size of the issues and also the size of the 
milestones/releases. Try to keep each milestone small, although having a 
milestone for only one issue might be a bit too small. :smile:

1. Go back to the *Issues* tab.
1. For each of the issues that should be assigned to the milestone:
    1. Press its name so you see the issue details.
    1. Press the cogwheel besides *Milestone*. Choose the desired milestone.
