# Milestone execution
In this step, it's time to do some actual work done that's not purely 
documentation.

## Assign issues
Issues should be left unassigned until someone is willing to start working on 
them. When you are ready to start working on an issue, you should assign it to 
yourself.

1. Go to the issue list belonging to the milestone you're currently working on.
1. Click on an issue that is unassigned. You can see if it is by the lack of an 
avatar in the `Assignee` column.
1. In the sidebar to the right and at the top is a heading called `Assignees`. 
Either click the link `No one---assign yourself` or click the little cogwheel 
and select yourself.
