# Issues

## Create issue
1. On the repository front page, press the *Issues* tab.
1. Press the green *New issue* button.
1. Write a short but descriptive *Title*. Example: `Make all buttons have 
yellow backgrounds and pink text colour`.
1. If you want to write more than just that short description, feel free to 
write it in the *Leave a comment* text box. Here you can write implementation 
details if you want, or perhaps argue for why this issue was created.
1. Assign a user by pressing the cogwheel besides *Assignees*. This can always 
be altered later, so if you're not sure about to whom to assign this issue, 
it's better to leave it empty for now.
1. Labels should at this stage have been created. If they haven't, please 
follow the [instructions on setting up basic labels][1] before continuing. When 
there are basic labels setup, press the cogwheel besides *Labels* and choose 
all labels that apply.
1. Leave both *Project* and *Milestone* be for now.
1. Press the *Submit new issue* button.
