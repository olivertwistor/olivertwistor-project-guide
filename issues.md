# Issues

## Create issue
1. On the repository front page, press the *Issues* tab.
1. Press the green *New issue* button.
1. Write a short but descriptive *Title*. Example: `Make all buttons have 
yellow backgrounds and pink text colour`.
1. If you want to write more than just that short description, feel free to 
write it in the *Leave a comment* text box. Here you can write implementation 
details if you want, or perhaps argue for why this issue was created.
1. Assign a user by pressing the cogwheel besides *Assignees*. This can always 
be altered later, so if you're not sure about to whom to assign this issue, 
it's better to leave it empty for now.
1. Press the cogwheel besides *Labels* and choose all labels that apply.
1. Leave both *Project* and *Milestone* be for now.
1. Press the *Submit new issue* button.

## Assign issues
Issues should be left unassigned until someone is willing to start working on 
them. When you are ready to start working on an issue, you should assign it to 
yourself.

1. Click on an issue that is unassigned. You can see if it is by the lack of an 
avatar in the `Assignee` column.
1. In the sidebar to the right and at the top is a heading called `Assignees`. 
Either click the link `No one -- assign yourself` or click the small cogwheel 
and select yourself.
