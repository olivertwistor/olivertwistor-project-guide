# Branching
## Release
A branch of this type should be created whenever it's time for a new release of the project. It should be created from the `develop` branch. On a release branch, only bug fixes and documentation may be added.

Release branches should be named with the version number corresponding to that release. For example, `release/1.7.4`.

When all work on the release branch is done, it should be merged with both the `master` and `develop` branches.
