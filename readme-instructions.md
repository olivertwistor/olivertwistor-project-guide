# Readme instructions

## Installation instructions
In this section of the readme file, you will write step-by-step instructions on 
how to install and configure the application, library or whatever your project 
is. All the necessary prerequisites should also be listed, including on how to 
download and install those (or preferrably links to their own instructions, as 
they are more likely to be more accurate and updated).

Be as specific as possible when listing prerequisites and their version 
numbers. By using build tools such as [Ant][1] or [Gradle][2], this step may be 
easier for the user because you as the developer is in more control over 
dependencies and prerequisites.

## Usage instructions
In this section of the readme file, you will write how to use the application, 
library or whatever your project is. This is no place for a full manual, but at 
a minimum, explain how to interact with the most common functionality. I 
recommend including examples, especially for libraries, to show the most common 
API calls and expected outputs.
