In this folder, we store templates for various documents, such as readmes and 
changelogs.

All these templates follow the same formatting rules, as outlined in this 
document. Note that this document doesn't follow the formatting rules.

## Bold text
**Bold text** is meant for instructions, explanations and discussion. This type 
of text is meant to be read and then deleted before you publish the final 
document.

## Italic text
*Italic text* is meant to be placeholders of text you should substitute for 
your own. This can be headings, whole paragraphs or single words within a 
sentence. Some examples:

> *To run this program you will need a working web server with PHP >= 7.2.*

> The first thing you should do to join the dev team is send an e-mail to 
> *your e-mail address*.

Plain text is meant for text that should be preserved verbatim when you publish 
the final document.
