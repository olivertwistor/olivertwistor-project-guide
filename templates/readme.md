# Templates folder
In this folder, we store templates for various documents, such as readmes and changelogs. 

Feel free to remove any section or paragraph in these templates that doesn't suit your particular project's need.

All these templates follow the same formatting rules, as outlined in this document. Note that this document doesn't itself follow these formatting rules.

## Bold text
**Bold text** is meant for instructions, explanations and discussion. This type of text is meant to be read and then deleted before you publish the final document.

## Italic text
*Italic text* is meant to be placeholders of text you should substitute for your own. This can be whole paragraphs or single words within a sentence. Some examples:

> To run this program you will need a working web server with PHP >= 7.2.

> The first thing you should do to join the dev team is send an e-mail to *your e-mail address*.

It may be difficult to distinguish italic text from plain text. I suggest that you view the files in raw format. Italic text is marked like this: `*italic text*`.

For places where it's not possible to have italic text, such as in headings, an arrow and the text "(change this)" will follow the text that would be italic, like this:

    # Project name <-- (change this)

## Plain text
Plain text is meant for text that should be preserved verbatim when you publish the final document. Within a plain text paragraph, there might be hyperlinks to for example your Github profile or Github root folder. The targets of those hyperlinks (and if necessary, even the text, should obviously be changed to your particular project. Often, I mark these occurrences somewhere in a preceding or succeeding paragraph.
