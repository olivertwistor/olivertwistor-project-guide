## Background
**Here, you should write something about the context in which this project 
lives.**

## Purpose
**Here, you would describe what problem your application or library solves. The 
purpose is a high-level vision statement; it should tell the reader what the 
long-term goals are. It shouldn't be a feature list &mdash; that is better 
suited for the [Goal section][3].**

*Example: The purpose of this application is to help people collaborate on 
drawings.**

*Another example: This library aims to make it easy to parse an RSS feed.**

## Goal
**Here, you should list a number of features or other measurable goals your 
application or library should reach. You can keep this section pretty 
high-level if you want. It should be much more concrete than what's in the 
[Purpose section][2], though.**

*Example for an offline journaling application:*
* *Runnable on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.*
* *Ability to write multiple journal entries.*
* *Simple formatting: bold, italic, underscore. Ability to set font and font 
size.*
* *Full-text search in the whole journal.*

*Example for a library for converting between temperature scales:*
* *Written in Java.*
* *Conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.*
* *Conversion between Celsius and Kelvin.*
* *Conversion between Celsius and Réaumur.*
* *Conversion between Fahrenheit and Kelvin.*
* *Conversion between Fahrenheit and Réaumur.*
* *Conversion between Kelvin and Réaumur.*
