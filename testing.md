# Testing
Testing is a good thing. It should be done wherever and whenever feasible. I'm not religious about it, though. Sergey Kolodiy have written an excellent [article about unit testing][1].

Each project should detail the testing frameworks in use, in their respective `README.md` file. Test code should be committed to the Git repository so other contributors can benefit from it.
