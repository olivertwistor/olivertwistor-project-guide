# Project end
Normally, a programming project never ends. However, if you do want to end a 
project for whatever reason, you should tell people about that.

Write something like this near the top in the `README.md` file:

```
This project was officially ended 2019-12-25. Therefore, do not expect further 
development. Feel free to clone this repository to continue working on the 
project yourself.
```

It would also be a good idea to [archive the Github repo][1]. That will create 
a clear signal that no more work is expected to be made to the project.
