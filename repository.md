# Repository
The following instructions are tailored for Git repositories hosted by Github. 
If you're using some other version control system (such as CVS, SVN or 
Mercurial) or if you're using some other platform (such as Bitbucket, GitLab or 
perhaps your own server), some of the instructions won't apply to you. Please 
refer to the manuals for your version control system or platform for specific 
instructions.

## Create a Github repository
These instructions presume that you already have a Github account and are 
logged in.

1. Go to https://github.com/new to create a new repository.
1. Choose a *Repository name*.
1. Write a short *Description* of what the project is about.
1. Choose between making the repository *Public* or *Private*. Public 
repositories are to be preferred since making it open source gives back to the 
community. For client work and the like, choose *Private*.
1. Press the button *Create repository*.

## Enable issues
Issues are a great way for yourself and others to keep track of what needs to 
be done (and what already has been done).

1. On the repository front page, go to the *Settings* tab.
1. Scroll down to *Features*.
1. Check the *Issues* checkbox.
