# Documentation
## Changelog
The changelog is a file that details all the (significant) changes done to the code between releases. More specifically, it details changes to the API. Thus, the intended audience is not primarily the end-user, but instead other developers.

The changelog should be written to a file called `CHANGELOG.md`, be stored in the repository root and follow the same format as [Keep a Changelog][1].

## Release notes
The release notes is a file that is similar to the [changelog][2], but instead of detailing changes in the API, the release notes should detail changes visible to the end-user. This distinction may not be as important for a library (where the end-user is another developer interested in the API) as it is for an application. 

The types of things that should be documented in the release notes are new, changed or removed functionality, changes in button or menu placements, new or changed configuration options etc.

The release notes should be written to a file called `RELEASE.md`, be stored in the repository root and follow the same format as [Keep a Changelog][1].
