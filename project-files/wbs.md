# Work Breakdown Structure
Work units that have yet to become Github issues.

* Make clear that the priorities relate to the *current* release, not the 
entire project; for example `priority: must` for version 1.7.4 is not meant as 
a must for the program to function at all, but more as a must for 
that *version* to function
* Define terms like SHALL/SHOULD, CAN/COULD etc. for what must be done, what's 
recommended etc. and be consistent throughout this model.
* The example project documents may be better placed in a separate repository. 
If we do that, we should mark that repository as a template so new projects can 
start with a complete instruction on how to work with the project.
* Maybe also do the same for the programming style guide. With that a new 
project will have both project documentation and a style guide ready to go. The 
project creator may then delete the documentation when they have gotten a good 
start.
